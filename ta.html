    <p> The Christmas fairies have a most unusual written language.</p>
	<p> It sounds amazing when spoken, but written it looks peculiar.</p>
	<p>It uses a simple sequence of dots and lines on a bar of lines.</p>
	<p> Each dot corresponds to a letter of the english alphabet.</p>
	<p> A, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, I, and so on. A, of course, being on the bottom line; the spaces being pauses.</p>
	<p>It's a most striking resemblance to the sheets I have on my instrument back at home...</p>
