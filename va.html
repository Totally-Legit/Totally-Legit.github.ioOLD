    <p>AH HA.</p>
	<p> AT LAST AT LAST AT LAST I HAVE CREATED THE ULTIMATE EEEEEVIL!</p>
	<p> WITH THESE, I WILL BRING MAGIC TO THE HUMANS, BUT ALSO, DESPAIR!</p>
	<p>My tiny orbs of doom, which I keep on the ever-tree, will be their downfall!</p>
	<p> ...as long as SANTA doesn't neutralize them. </p>
	<p>But even if he does, there is one he may never take the power from!</p>
	<p>I have sent it to the human world this instant!</p>
	<p>Hopefully it is found rather quickly, since it would be rather out of place. Who knows what else might befall the human  that day.</p>
	<p>He he heh he. HAH HA HA ha.</p>
