    <p>I must write this quickly as I am hiding for my life this very moment.</p>
	<p>Someone must know of my fate.</p>
	<p>My name is Gob. I was forging for puddleglooms(those lovely, lovely shrooms) when suddenly I stumbled and fell into a cave.</p>
	<p> The location was huge and brightly lit, but rough and untamed unlike dwarf caves.</p>
	<p> In one corner was a pile of small pouches and in the other was a terrible, slumbering, hamster like beast!</p>
	<p> I tip=toed over to the pouches. They were small and would barely fit on my FOOT.</p>
	<p> Then I found tiny little beasts sleeping in them!</p>
	<p> I picked up as many as I could and ran, the beast now chasing after me.</p>
	<p>How would my wife and children handle being present while they burry me in my grave?</p>
	<p> Beware reader! Do not, I repeat, DO NOT go and find these strange pouches.</p>
	<p>I SWEAR nothing good will come of it.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>P.S. DO NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS but I think someone may be following you too reader!</p>
	<p> They may be seeking this line,word thingy: (5,18),(9,16),(9,9),(4,2)</p>
