    <p>OH HOW I ADORE IT</p>
	<p>BuT tHeSe siLLy huMaNs tAkE aLl of IT to tHeiR WoRlD.</p>
	<p>I would gnaw all day if I could.</p>
	<p>THEY MUST NOT HAVE IT!</p>
	<p>I would carve my deepest desires into it.</p>
	<p> THE HUMANS MUST NOT HAVE IT.</p>
	<p>It tastes so good to me. I make my houses of it.</p>
	<p> THE HUMANS DON'T DESERVE IT.</p>
	<p> But alas, they have taken it to their forbidden workshops. Those that are filled with all sorts of unholy machinery.</p>
	<p> Goodbye, my love. My deepest pleasure....</p>
	<p> ROTTEN HUMANS!!!</p>
